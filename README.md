Getting and Cleaning Data Course Activities


The run_analysis.R script reads data sets, "train", "test" and some data sets with descriptions, 
combining them together to generate a unique set of data in order to extract the mean and standard 
deviation among the measures contained, gathering their common data.  After that, the resulting
dataset is agregated to provide mean and standard deviation mean.
