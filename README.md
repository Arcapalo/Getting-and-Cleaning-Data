Getting and Cleaning Data Course Activities

The run_analysis.R script reads data sets, "train", "test" and some data sets with respective descriptions, combining them together to generate a tidy set of data in order to extract the mean and standard deviation among the measures contained, gathering their common data. After that, the resulting dataset is agregated to provide mean and standard deviation mean.

To achive this objective, the first step was the obtention and concatenation of descriptive data for "trains" and "test", followed by the extraction of the measures of interest on each set.
Finally, the sets were merged and writen as a new data set.
